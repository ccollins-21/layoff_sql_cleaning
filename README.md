# Processing and Cleaning Data in MySQL
This project features the processing and cleaning of data relating to work layoffs around the world during 2020-2023. This was done using MySQL Workbench. 
I got the original dataset from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/MySQL-YouTube-Series/blob/main/layoffs.csv.
